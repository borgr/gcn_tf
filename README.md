# gcn_tf
This project is an implementation of gcn with labels and gating as used in 
Marcheggiani, D., & Titov, I. (2017). Encoding sentences with graph convolutional networks for semantic role labeling. arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.04826.
It should be easily compatible with tensorflow behaviour (perhaps some version changes must apply, feel free to Pull request)

This was originally implemented as a part of unpublished work by Leshem Choshen of syntactic GCNs for MT.
